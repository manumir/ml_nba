to do:


improvements:
	dataset only players (next season maybe)


better code:
	this line in update_data.py:
		#file_existing_lines=file_existing_lines[0:1]+file_existing_lines[:0:-1]
		was run only one time to get the raw2019-20.csv file from less
		recent to most recent, and now i don't need it anymore
		but MAYBE(don't know for sure) next season i do, maybe if i update
		from the start the file i don't, but if i have to scrape with nba scraper,
		i do need it.
