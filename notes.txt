to do:
	-until 11/07/2019(included) i predicted games based on last 6 games minus the most
	recent (2º,3º,4º,5º,6º)
	-add missing data on logs on date 11/09/2019

improvements:
	dataset only players (next season maybe)


better code:
	this line in update_data.py:
		#file_existing_lines=file_existing_lines[0:1]+file_existing_lines[:0:-1]
		was run only one time to get the raw2019-20.csv file from less
		recent to most recent, and now i don't need it anymore
		but MAYBE(don't know for sure) next season i do, maybe if i update
		from the start the file i don't, but if i have to scrape with nba scraper,
		i do need it.
