to do:
	-plac_preds.py has to add zeros added before day and month (2/1/19 to 02/01/19)
	-hardcoded stuff in update_data.py relating the year variable
	-change plac_preds.py to know when all the games are on placard's site
	-check mathematicaly the best possible ROI (disagreed matches?? or all games??)

done:
	-test from 12/01/19 with & without fatigue (got 63.63% with & 63.13% without) @ 30/12/2019
	-change bets_simulation to bet only on dissagreed outcomes
	-change calc.py to calculate accurately everytime

notes:
	-until 11/07/2019(included) i predicted games based on last 6 games minus the most recent (2º,3º,4º,5º,6º) (on linear)
	-i guess mathematicaly the best possible ROI is if i
	only bet on the disagreed matches??
	-take into account the placard changes during the day to simulate the bets (bets_simulation.py)
  -the xgboost package takes wayyy too much space
  -the multi-layer percepton model (mlp) changes somewhat significatively when i run it on linux vs windows

improvements:
	- whole different model; based on stats of players, then create
		teams, see who's playing in the game to predict (exclude injuried players etc...).

better code:
	this line in update_data.py:
		#file_existing_lines=file_existing_lines[0:1]+file_existing_lines[:0:-1]
		was run only one time to get the raw2019-20.csv file from less
		recent to most recent, and now i don't need it anymore
		but MAYBE(don't know for sure) next season i do, maybe if i update
		from the start the file i don't, but if i have to scrape with nba scraper,
		i do need it.
