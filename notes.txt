to do:

	1.delete .joblib files, delete predictors;
		predict games on the same file that we train
		the models;in other words, train the models
		everyday and then predict the games

	2.change concat.py to concat raw_years.csv
		to concat by dataframes not with native python
		because raw_2019-20.csv is a dataframe. (it 
		has features as the first line while others
		raw_years don't)

improvements:
	dataset only players
